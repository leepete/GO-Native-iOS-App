# GO-Native iOS app - (A working iOS concept)

An app my team and I made to engage kids with the environment, finding New Zealand native birds @ Create Camp 2018 (previously known as Hackfest).

It's like Pokemon GO but with Birds!

We initially made it in JavaScript but I ported the app myself to iOS.
