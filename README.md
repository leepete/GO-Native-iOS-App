## Info

An app made to help engage kids with the environment by collecting/finding New Zealand native birds outside and learning about them.  

This idea was first created at Summer of Tech Create Camp 2018, and I was inspired to keep going with the idea and attempt to making something out of it.

I coded it up in **Swift** (no use of storyboards).
